## Introduction

Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Early diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's Disease can greatly help in providing timely intervention and treatment to patients. This repository provides a deep learning model based on the NASNet Large architecture to predict the likelihood of a patient developing Alzheimer's Disease.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of medical imaging data, specifically brain MRI scans, collected from patients with and without Alzheimer's Disease. The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing restrictions. However, you can obtain similar datasets from publicly available sources or by collaborating with research institutions and obtaining appropriate permissions.

## Model Architecture

The NASNet Large architecture is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for image classification tasks. It is known for its excellent performance on various image classification benchmarks. The model consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The weights of the model are pretrained on a large-scale dataset and fine-tuned on the Alzheimer's Disease dataset provided.

## Usage

To use this Alzheimer's Disease prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alzheimers-prediction-nasnet-large.git
   

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   bash
   cd alzheimers-prediction-nasnet-large
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Preprocess your brain MRI scans into the appropriate format required by the model. Ensure that your data is organized in a suitable directory structure.

4. Train the model using the preprocessed data. Adjust the hyperparameters and training configurations as per your requirements.
   bash
   python train.py
   

5. After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new brain MRI scans. Adjust the prediction script according to your needs.
   bash
   python predict.py --image path/to/brain_mri_scan.jpg
   

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the Alzheimer's Disease prediction task. It should be noted that the performance of the model may vary depending on the quality and size of the dataset used for training.
